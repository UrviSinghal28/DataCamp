Fitting multi-class logistic regression

In this exercise, you'll fit the two types of multi-class logistic regression, one-vs-rest and softmax/multinomial, on the handwritten digits data set and compare the results. The handwritten digits dataset is already loaded and split into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test.

Instructions

Fit a one-vs-rest logistic regression classifier and report the results.

Fit a multinomial logistic regression classifier by setting the multi_class parameter, plus setting to be solver = "lbfgs", and report the results.
