Visualizing decision boundaries

In this exercise, you'll visualize the decision boundaries of various classifier types.

A subset of scikit-learn's built-in wine dataset is already loaded into X, along with binary labels in y.

Instructions

Create the following classifier objects with default hyperparameters: LogisticRegression, LinearSVC, SVC, KNeighborsClassifier.

Fit each of the classifiers on the provided data using a for loop.

Call the plot_4_classifers() function (similar to the code here), passing in X, y, and a list containing the four classifiers.
