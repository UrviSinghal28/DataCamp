KNN classification

In this exercise you'll explore a subset of the Large Movie Review Dataset. The variables X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test are already loaded into the environment. The X variables contain features based on the words in the movie reviews, and the y variables contain labels for whether the review sentiment is positive (+1) or negative (-1).
