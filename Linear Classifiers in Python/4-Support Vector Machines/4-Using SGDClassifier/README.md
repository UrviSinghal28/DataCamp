Using SGDClassifier

In this final coding exercise, you'll do a hyperparameter search over the regularization type, regularization strength, and the loss (logistic regression vs. linear SVM) using SGDClassifier().

Instructions

Instantiate an SGDClassifier instance with random_state=0.

Search over the regularization strength, the hinge vs. log losses, and L1 vs. L2 regularization.
